# Attendee Badge Customization

We offer three attendee badge templates:

<BadgeTemplates />

For all attendees, the first template style (Nix color scheme) will be used by default.

The `#name` and `#type` fields on the badge will be determined by the information you provide during registration and your attendance role (Attendee / Volunteer / Speaker).

To select a different template or make other customizations, file a request here:
