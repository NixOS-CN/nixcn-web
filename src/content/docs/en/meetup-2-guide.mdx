## Transportation

### Arriving in Shanghai

Shanghai is accessible by air or by rail.

Arriving via Jinshan North Rail Station or Nanxiang North Rail Station is possible but strongly discouraged because they are exceptionally far from the venue. Please pay attention to the distinctions when purchasing tickets.

Due to the considerable distance from all aforementioned transport hubs to the venue, please take careful note of the **first and last service times** of public transportation (metro, bus, etc.) and allow ample time for transfers.
